### Issue Type
Please classify the issue as related to one or multiple of the following 
categories. A brief description of the types are provided below but more 
information can be found [here](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).

__* Findability of SuperDARN data__  
Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. This 
includes issues that relate to finding the dataset or information about the 
dataset.

__* Accessibility of SuperDARN data__  
Once the user finds the required data, she/he needs to know how can they be 
accessed, including authentication and authorisation.

__* Interoperability of SuperDARN data__  
The data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data 
need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis, storage, and 
processing. This includes issues with understanding or making use of the 
dataset using common processing methods. 

__* Reusability of SuperDARN data__  
The ultimate goal of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, 
metadata and data should be well-described so that they can be replicated 
and/or combined in different settings. 

__* Standard Infringement__
An issue that relates to a current and _documented_ standard being infringed 
upon. Please provide reference to the standard.
