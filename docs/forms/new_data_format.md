# DSWG NEW STANDARD DATA FORMAT FORM

Please complete the following form and email to darn-dswg@isee.nagoya-u.ac.jp. 

### Submitter Name and Institution
Name:  
Institution:  
Preferred contact method (e.g., email):  

### Purpose of Standardization
Please identify why you would like to standardize the format you are proposing.

There are multiple reasons to standardize a new format. These may include:  

* A new format for distribution, which makes science easier for users and/or 
  attracts new users to the dataset  
* An improvement to an existing format that modifies the fields in the format  
* A novel production method, that produces a new format where it would benefit
  the SuperDARN community to be aware of the definition of the fields in the 
  format and how to use the format in their own research should they choose  
* Other reason (please detail)  

### Production Method
Provide a description of the production or processing method and summarize the novelty
of the format in comparison to other available standardized (or non-standardized)
formats. Provide references to papers, if applicable. Summarize the benefit 
to SuperDARN data users. Summarize how the format could be used in other data
products. Provide links to plotting routines, if applicable.

### Access to Production Method
Provide a link or other method for the DSWG to access and test your 
production/processing method that produces this format. Provide your suggested 
method of distributing this software to end users. Briefly describe how you 
have tested and verified your method (and list other contributors, if applicable).

### Requirements of Data Format
Please describe or give a reference for documentation on:   

* Fields in the format: name and brief comment on data type and definition.  
* Binary format chosen for the file, and method(s) available for file read
    and write for users should this format become standardized and accessible
    to new users. Describe what programming language(s) you have tested with 
    this format, if applicable.

### Method of Integration with Existing Formats
Please detail how this format might integrate with existing formats. For example:  

If this is a *new format for distribution to users*, please provide suggestions 
for how this format might be distributed.

If this is an *improvement to an existing format*, please suggest how to 
integrate this format with the old (is reprocessing required? how might code 
belonging to users be affected by the change?)

If this is a *new format from a novel production method*, please provide 
a link to conversion code, if applicable and available. Please provide your 
distribution method if you intend to distribute. Otherwise, no additional 
information is required.
