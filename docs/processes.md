#### Steps

The DSWG consideration process is as follows:

**1. Submissions to Working Group for Consideration**

 Any person who uses SuperDARN data can submit an issue to the DSWG. The issue should be submitted using the [issue submission form](https://github.com/SuperDARN/dswg-info/blob/master/docs/forms/issue.md) and emailed to the working group, or by submitting an issue on github [here](https://github.com/SuperDARN/dswg-info/issues/new/choose) using the DSWG issue submission form template.

 Any person who has developed a new or updated processing method, operating software, or radar technique may propose a new or updated data format to accompany their technique for standardized use among the community. Improvements to processing methods that do not modify the data format do not need to be reviewed. The proposed new format should be submitted using the [new data format form](https://github.com/SuperDARN/dswg-info/blob/master/docs/forms/new_data_format.md) and emailed to the working group, or by submitting an issue on github [here](https://github.com/SuperDARN/dswg-info/issues/new/choose) using the DSWG new standard data format form template.

 Issues submitted by email will be copied as an issue onto the github page, for easy tracking of issues in one location. Issues at this point will be given the status label 'pending review'.

**2. Decision to Pursue**  

 All submissions to the working group will be considered at the next scheduled working group meeting. The meeting agenda will be provided to all members in advance of the meeting so that all members can provide their input on the decision to pursue. 

 * __Issues__

 	DSWG issues should be within the scope of the DSWG mandate for SuperDARN data products only. The DSWG will review all submitted issue statements and will decide on whether to pursue solutions based on whether the issue is within their scope. 

 * __New Proposed Formats__

 	The DSWG will review if the proposed new format could be of benefit to the community as a whole and will decide whether to consider standardization. The DSWG may ask further questions of the submission to help in its review process. 

 If the DSWG decides to pursue the issue, it will forward a concise email with priorities including the latest addition to the Executive Council via its Chair to receive feedback. The email will include justification for pursuing the issue and the date of the next DSWG meeting. The Executive Council will respond with revisions/confirmation/rejection of new issue before solutions can be considered. The PIs may also provide ideas for solutions after confirmation, but to allow for continuation of the process the solutions must be received before the second revision of the report.

 Once the DSWG has decided to consider solutions to the issue or consider new proposed formats, the github issue will be updated with the status as either 'in the queue' if the WG has prioritized other issues, or 'report in progress' if the WG is currently working on this issue. If the DSWG has decided that the issue or new proposed format is out of scope, the issue will be labelled 'out of scope' and will be closed.

**3. Report Writing Process**  

 * __Issues__

 	The DSWG will aim to consider all solutions and their impacts on various groups (including all SuperDARN PI institutions). 

 	The report will be written using the outline below. Though this may look extensive, reports should be concise and we will aim for maximum 10 pages, depending on the scope of the issue.

	* _Summary_  
	* _Problem Statement_  
		The statement of issue, written by the DSWG. The original issue statement(s) as submitted to the DSWG will be provided as an appendix. Multiple original issue statements may be combined into a single report if the statements have the same scope.  
	* _Background Information_  
		Historical information, impact of issue on the SuperDARN data set and user groups   
	* _Alternatives_  
		List of possible solutions and discussion of their impacts to various groups. Discussion of the impact of doing nothing.  
	* _Analysis_  
		Metrics used to evaluate and the relative performance of alternatives   
	* _DSWG Recommendation_  
		The recommended solution of the DSWG (approved through a vote), including a justification and description of the benefits of this solution. Counterarguments addressed, if they have not been already.   
	* _Suggested Steps for Implementation_   
		Details, including a suggested timeline, suggested procedure if applicable.   
	* _Conclusions_  
		A review of the importance of the issue and a suggested meeting motion that could be made at the PI meeting.  
   
 * __New Proposed Formats__

 	The report will be written using the outline below. The report will aim to be concise, in the range of 5 - 15 pages depending on the extent of the novelty of the proposed new format.

	* _Summary_  
	* _Proposed New Data Format for Standardization_  
		Brief description of the new format  
	* _Background Information_  
		Historical information, review of existing formats, proposed benefits of new format and proposed method of integrating new format (for secondary formats: use of RST, new software package, etc.)  
	* _Analysis_  
		Benefits and drawbacks of standardizing the new format. Benefits and drawbacks of methods of integration.  
	* _DSWG Recommendation_  
		The recommended solution of the DSWG (approved through a vote) on whether to standardize and suggested method to do so. Counterarguments addressed, if they have not been already.   
	* _Suggested Steps for Implementation_   
		Details, including a suggested timeline, suggested procedure if applicable.   
	* _Conclusions_   
		A review of the importance of the issue and a suggested meeting motion that could be made at the PI meeting.  

 The DSWG will utilize a private github repo to collaborate on the report. The working group will aim to objectively evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the various solutions. All working group members can contribute to the report. 
 
 The DSWG will begin by writing a preliminary report exploring the various solutions (which includes all sections of the outline prior to the *DSWG Recommendation*. One or several scheduled meetings will be used to brainstorm key points for each section of the preliminary report. The WG will also gather information on the issue at this time, and may make use of polls to the wider community or ask for input from any group involved to inform the creation of alternatives. 
 
 Following brainstorming, members may volunteer to write the first draft of various preliminary sections of the report (excluding recommendation, suggested steps for implementation, and conclusions, which can only be written following the vote for recommended solution). Deadlines for first draft of the preliminary report will be set, giving maximum 2-3 weeks time for writing.

 After the first draft of preliminary sections is complete and a pull request is created on github, the DSWG will review the first draft of the report using github. A deadline for first draft reviews will be set (1-2 weeks). Reviewers should check primarily for missing key points, and secondly for objective content. Caution should be exercised however in removing content. Content may be removed if it is:

 - subjective (in which case can the content be made more objective?)  
 - out of scope of the issue itself (does this concern another issue? However, is it still relevant depending on the solution?)  
 - has excess detail about a certain point (the report aims to be concise - could a reference be used instead?)  

 A new, second volunteer will be selected to revise the report according to recommendations. The second draft will have a deadline of 2-3 weeks, following the end of the first review. The second writer for any given section should differ from the first writer of the section, to encourage objective writing and remove some personal bias.

 Once the second writer has finished with their revisions, the DSWG community will then have a second opportunity of 1-2 weeks to review the report. A telecon will be held following the second review to settle content disputes and agree on final details. If necessary, a volunteer will be selected for revisions (may be the first or second writer if they wish). 

 **4. DSWG Recommended Solution**  

 After the preliminary report is agreed upon, a 48-hour period will be set for voting on the recommended solution. Please note that the sections contained in the preliminary report will not be revised further after is has been approved at the WG meeting. This means the preliminary report cannot be changed during the lead-up to the voting, during voting, or after voting. All WG members are expected to provide their input on the solutions offered during the earlier preliminary report writing and review process. 

 The dates of the vote will be communicated both on the github and via email to all members of the WG. Voting will be done via ranked ballot on SurveyMonkey. The poll will be sent via email to the members of the WG. The chair will set up the poll with the solutions proposed in the preliminary report. The preliminary report will be available on the private github repo for all members to review and determine their preferred ranking. 

 The chair will export the result of the poll and send to all members of the WG for their review, following the poll. 

 **5. Report Completion**  

 Following the poll, the WG will have a scheduled meeting for their final ideas related to a timeline, procedure (if part of the solution), and other ideas that could make any transitions to the recommended solution easier or more convenient. A volunteer writer will then write up the last three sections: DSWG Recommendation, Suggested Steps for Implementation, and Conclusions. Again, a maximum of 2-3 weeks will be provided for writing, and another 1-2 weeks for review. A final scheduled meeting will be held to approve the report before it is sent to the PIs for their review. 
 
 Note that ultimately the PIs are under no obligation to implement the recommendation from the report. The recommendation just gives additional information on the community's views and level of agreement. Also, the PIs are welcome to return the report after it has been submitted if they think something important has been missed. On the other hand, if there is general consensus within both groups, the PIs are able to move forward quickly on those issues with the recommended solution and can consider the suggested steps for implementation.
