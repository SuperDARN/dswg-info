## DSWG Processes

As approved by the DSWG Feb 27 2020

The DSWG consideration process will differ based on whether the issue relates to current standard data formats and their use, or if the issue is one of a new development.

**1. Process for Issues with Existing Standard Data Formats**

 Any person who uses SuperDARN data can submit an issue to the DSWG. Issues should be submitted in a short paragraph detailing the problem, but not include possible solutions. A preferred solution may be provided by the submitter as a response following  the issue statement. An issue statement form needs to be created for this. 

 DSWG issues should be within the scope of the DSWG mandate for SuperDARN data products only. The DSWG will review all submitted issue statements and will decide on whether to pursue solutions based on whether the issue is within their scope. 

 Approved issues, as they arise, will be given a numeric label and a report will be directed to the PIs. The DSWG will aim to consider all solutions and their impacts on various groups (including all SuperDARN PI institutions). 

 Suggested outline of the report detailed below. Though this may look extensive, reports should be concise and we will aim for anywhere from 5 -10 pages, depending on the scope of the issue.

 DSWG Issue Recommendation Report Outline:

 _Summary_  
 _Problem Statement_  
 The statement of issue, written by the DSWG. The original issue statement(s) as submitted to the DSWG will be provided as an appendix. Multiple original issue statements may be combined into a single report if the statements have the same scope.  
 _Background Information_  
 Historical information, impact of issue on the SuperDARN data set and user groups   
 _Alternatives_  
 List of possible solutions and discussion of their impacts to various groups. Discussion of the impact of doing nothing.  
 _Analysis_  
 Metrics used to evaluate and the relative performance of alternatives   
 _DSWG Recommendation_  
 The recommended solution of the DSWG (approved through a vote), including a justification and description of the benefits of this solution. Counterarguments addressed, if they have not been already.   
 _Suggested Steps for Implementation_   
 Details, including a suggested timeline, suggested procedure if applicable.   
 _Conclusions_  
 A review of the importance of the issue and a suggested meeting motion that could be made at the PI meeting.  
 
 Once completed and approved by the DSWG, the report will be forwarded to the PIs for their review.

**2. Process for Proposed New Standard Data Formats**

Any person who has developed a new or updated processing method, operating software, or radar technique may propose a new or updated data format to accompany their technique for standardized use among the community. Improvements to processing methods that do not modify the data format do not need to be reviewed. A new standard data format form should be created for this. The form should be used to detail the novelty or improvements of the new format, proposed integration with existing formats, proposed distribution of processing software necessary (if applicable), etc., as necessary for standardizing the format. 

The DSWG will review if the proposed new format could be of benefit to the community as a whole and will decide whether to consider standardization. The DSWG may ask further questions of the submission to help in its review process. If the DSWG decides to consider standardization, the new data format issue will be given a numeric label and a report will be directed to the PIs. The suggested outline is shown below. The report will aim to be concise, in the range of 5 - 15 pages depending on the extent of the novelty of the proposed new format.

DSWG New Format Recommendation Report Outline:

_Summary_  
_Proposed New Data Format for Standardization_  
Brief description of the new format  
_Background Information_  
Historical information, review of existing formats, proposed benefits of new format and proposed method of integrating new format (for secondary formats: use of RST, new software package, etc.)  
_Analysis_  
Benefits and drawbacks of standardizing the new format. Benefits and drawbacks of methods of integration.  
_DSWG Recommendation_  
The recommended solution of the DSWG (approved through a vote) on whether to standardize and suggested method to do so. Counterarguments addressed, if they have not been already.   
_Suggested Steps for Implementation_   
Details, including a suggested timeline, suggested procedure if applicable.   
_Conclusions_   
A review of the importance of the issue and a suggested meeting motion that could be made at the PI meeting.  

Once completed and approved by the DSWG, the report will be forwarded to the PIs for their review.
